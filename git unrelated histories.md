fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories


The error "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories" occurs because your local repository and the remote repository have unrelated commit histories. This often happens if both repositories were initialized independently.

### SOLUTION

# Pull with the --allow-unrelated-histories Flag

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve Any Merge Conflicts

If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them manually. Stage the resolved files and commit:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

# Push Your Changes

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
