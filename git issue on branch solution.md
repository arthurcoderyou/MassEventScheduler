ChatGPT
The error indicates that your local branch is behind the remote branch, and Git is rejecting the push because it would overwrite remote changes. You need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository and then push your changes.

# STEPS TO RESOLVE

# Fetch and Merge Remote Changes

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
If there are merge conflicts, resolve them and then commit the changes.

# Push Your Changes

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
